Present.ly AIR
==============

This is the official Adobe AIR client for [Present.ly](http://www.presentlyapp.com/). 
We have released the source both as an example of how to utilize Present.ly's powerful 
Twitter-compatible API and with the hopes that members of the community might make
improvements that can then be shared and enjoyed by others.
